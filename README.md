# ImageClassifier

This is the repo that contains the code for the github hosted website: https://theeduardomora.github.io/ImageClassifier/

This website is built with ReactJS and uses a pre-trained Tensorflow JS Model called MobileNet https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet to classify images that a user uploads. The website displays its 
three most likely predictions along with their accompanying probabilities for each image. 

Visit https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/mobilenet/src/imagenet_classes.ts to see all the hardcoded labels that the model uses to make its predictions. 
Uploading any one of these images will yield the best results.
